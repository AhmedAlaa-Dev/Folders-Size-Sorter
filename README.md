## How to Use

1. **Place the Batch File**:  
   Move the batch file into the main directory that contains subfolders whose sizes you want to analyze.

2. **Run the Script**:  
   Simply **double-click** the batch file to execute it.

3. **View the Results**:  
   The script will automatically:
   - Display the sizes of each subfolder, sorted from largest to smallest.
   - Save the output in a `.txt` file for later reference.

That’s it! The batch file creates a sorted size ranking of all folders – now you can analyze, organize, or optimize however you prefer.

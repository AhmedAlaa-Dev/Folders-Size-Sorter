# Folders-Size-Sorter
A simple batch script that helps identify the largest folder inside a directory. Since Windows doesn't display folder sizes by default, this script automates the process by listing all subfolders along with their sizes, sorting them from largest to smallest, and saving the output in a .txt file for reference.

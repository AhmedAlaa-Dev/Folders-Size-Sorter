# Folder Size Analyzer

## 📁 How to Use

### 1. Place the Batch File
Move the batch file into the **main directory** that contains the subfolders you want to analyze.

### 2. Run the Script
Simply **double-click** the batch file to execute it.

### 3. View the Results
The script will automatically:
- Display each subfolder's size (**sorted largest to smallest**)
- Save the ranked list in a `FoldersSize_Sorted.txt` file

💡 **That's it!** The batch file creates a sorted size ranking of all folders – use the data to analyze, organize, or optimize however you prefer.
